Predicting the price for an Airbnb Host in Berlin
==================================================


Airbnb has successfully disrupted the traditional hospitality industry as more and more </br> 
travelers decide to use Airbnb as their primary accommodation provider. Since its inception in 2008, </br> 
Airbnb has seen an enormous growth, with the number of rentals listed on its website growing exponentially each year.

This problem focuses on the accommodation features and decisions a new host can make with regards </br> 
to initial presentation, i.e. posting a picture of him- or herself on the website, determining a minimum </br> 
length of stay, offering instant bookings etc. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to try to get an answer.
